    <h2>Reading the News</h2>
    <p>
      The internet makes the world a smaller place. There are a lot of resources available online for you to stay updated with events happening locally, nationally and globally. Since news doesnâ€™t need to be printed and distributed, news spreads very quickly throughout the internet via news reporting websites. News sites like www.bbc.com and www.foxnews.com provide the most recent news updates throughout the day constantly updated on their website.

    <h2>Watching the News</h2>
    <p>
      The internet also provides us the resources to watch the news online. The same websites (BBC, CNN, Fox News and others) give you the ability to watch clips of the news associated to each news article.

      <strong>Word of Caution:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of the sheer number of news sites and headlines available through the internet, there are some news sources that project false, heavily biased and provocative news to attract more people on the internet. It is a good habit to have to fact check the news we read using other sources to get a better and a more clearer picture of the same.
